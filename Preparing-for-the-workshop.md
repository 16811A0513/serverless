## Create AWS Account
If you do not have any AWS account, go ahead and create an AWS account. AWS offers a generous free resources during the first year of your account and many of those goodies will not expire at the end of the 12 months. You can find more details of various resources available under free tier here: https://aws.amazon.com/free/

> For students, we suggest creating a regular **AWS Account** and then apply for **AWS Educate** credit, rather than **AWS Educate Starter Accounts**. Starter accounts are only good for the credit amount and cannot continue the account after credits expire. Starter Accounts are closed after expiration.

* To create a regular AWS Account, just visit https://aws.amazon.com/ and signup.

## AWS Educate
Visit https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/ to learn more about AWS Educate credits.
* Apply for AWS Educate : https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply/
