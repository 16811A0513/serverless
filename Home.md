Welcome to Developing Serverless Applications workshop.

## Getting Ready
Review [Preparing for the workshop](https://github.com/TeachingForGood/aws-serverless-workshop/wiki/Preparing-for-the-workshop) to prepare for the workshop. If you can, also go ahead and [setup your workspace](https://github.com/TeachingForGood/aws-serverless-workshop/wiki/Setting-up-the-workspace). All these tools in the eco-system are quite mature and if you run into any issues, you will be quickly able to find help to finish the setup. If you run into an issue that you do not find any help or couldn't resolve, please plan to arrive bit early so that one of the volunteers could help.
